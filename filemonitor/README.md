Dynamically log monitor
This script is used to dynamically monitor text files and output the changes to one console, which is very useful when 
administrator want to monitor multiple log files and view them in all in one place.  You also can create your own handle 
class to process the new lines for each file.

The script also can handle the case when the monitored files are renamed or deleted by polling file periodically.
